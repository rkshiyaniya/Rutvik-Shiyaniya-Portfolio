# Projects :

## 1. Real-time Face Mask Detector :

Tech. Stack :
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Face Detection (DNN Caffe Models)
- Transfer Learning (mobilenet_v2 base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet')

This project is built using above Tech. Stack.
For Face Detection DNN based caffe model has been used.
For Model training I have used Transfer Learning with 'mobilenet_v2' Neural Network base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet'.
I have made it Real-time with the help of OpenCV.

Tech. Stack :
- [x] Python
- [x] TensorFlow/Keras
- [x] OpenCV
- [x] DNN Caffe Models - face detection
- [x] mobilenet_v2 base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet'

- [x] Real-time Face Detection

* This Project is built using above Tech. Stack.
* For Face Detection DNN based caffe model has been used.
* For Model training I have used Transfer Learning with 'mobilenet_v2' Neural Network base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet'.
* I have made it Real-time with the help of OpenCV.

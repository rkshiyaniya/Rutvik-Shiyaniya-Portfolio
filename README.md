## Deep Learning (Computer Vision) Projects

### Real-time Face Mask Detector

Tech. Stack :
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- DNN Caffe Models - face detection
- mobilenet_v2 base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet'

Categories :
- Image Classification (Computer Vision)

- Real-time Face Detection

* This Project is built using above Tech. Stack.
* For Face Detection DNN based caffe model has been used.
* For Model training I have used Transfer Learning with 'mobilenet_v2' Neural Network base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet'.
* I have made it Real-time with the help of OpenCV.
